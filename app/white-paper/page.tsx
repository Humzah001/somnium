                    Cryopreservation is a widely used technique for the storage of isolated neural cells and has recently been demonstrated to maintain electrical activity in simple neural organoids. However, recovery of action potentials from cryopreserved acutely resected neural tissue remains an ongoing challenge for the field.

                    Cryopreservation of isolated cells is a ubiquitous technique that is required for the storage and shipment of primary neural progenitor cells <strong>(Hancock et al, 2000)</strong>. While neurons derived from these cells can provide some insights into single-cell biophysics and electrophysiology, their electrical activity is fundamentally different from neurons in the context of native microcircuits.
                  </p>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    For this reason, much neuroscience research is focused either in living organisms or in acute slices of tissue. Acute slices conveniently allow for electrical access to deep brain regions while maintaining much of the connectivity between cells <strong>(Frey et al, 2009)</strong>. Given the difficulty in quickly accessing and maintaining the viability of human brain tissue for research use, the vast majority of these experiments are performed on murine tissue, limiting translatability <strong>(Day et al, 2013)</strong>.

                    An effective method for cryopreservation of acutely resected neural tissue from human donors would enable cryostorage and shipment of these valuable research samples, unlocking a new platform for basic neuroscience research and drug development. Recently, a protocol for successful cryopreservation of lab-grown brain organoids was shown, with impressive maintenance of structure and electrical activity after rewarming <strong>(Xue et al, 2024)</strong>. However, the study did not demonstrate electrical activity in their cryopreserved sample of acutely resected neural tissue.

                    Organoids, while invaluable for modeling aspects of disease and early brain development, face limitations compared to acute tissue slices, such as a lack of mature cellular organization and functional connectivity, which can impact their translational relevance in neuroscience research <strong>(Qian & Song, 2019)</strong>.

                    To achieve viable preservation, we first diffusively loaded 300 micron thick acute rat cerebellar slices with a cryoprotectant solution <strong>(Fig1a and Fig1b)</strong> whose composition is identical to the established VMP cryoprotectant <strong>(Han et al. 2023, Fahy et al. 2004)</strong> save the removal of one component <strong>(X-1000 ice blocker)</strong>.

                    In preparation for cryopreservation, acute slices of rat cerebellum were placed in a multifunctional sample holder with a custom well for diffusive loading of cryoprotectant <strong>(Fig4)</strong>. The tissue was loaded with CPA, was rapidly cooled from 4ºC to -196ºC using a jet of liquid nitrogen <strong>(LN2)</strong>, and then was rewarmed using an alternating magnetic field from an induction heater <strong>(Fig1d and Fig1e)</strong>.

                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    The sample holder's perfusion well was then placed back on top of the sample and cryoprotectant was unloaded using a linear ramp in perfused concentration into the well from the maximum CPA concentration to no CPA in 500 seconds. After ~45 minutes of post-cryopreservation incubation, the slices were transferred to a multielectrode array <strong>(3Brain Duplex)</strong> where activity was recorded at baseline before the addition of carbachol and the later addition of tetrodotoxin <strong>(Fig2)</strong>.

                    For N=4 slices tested with this protocol, activity was present and the signal responded as expected to pharmacology with carbachol increasing activity from baseline and tetrodotoxin silencing action potentials. In Figure 2, we present data from one of these slices <strong>(additional data available upon request, email hunter@untillabs.com)</strong>.

                    At baseline, a number of electrodes detected high frequency spiking <strong>(Fig2b and Fig2c)</strong>. With application of carbachol to increase neural excitability, an increase in mean spike rate was observed. With tetrodotoxin application, spiking was blocked, confirming that the earlier signal represented physiological spiking.

                    While neural activity was present in multiple MEA channels, it is clear that there is a marked reduction in electrical activity following this cryopreservation protocol. Sample data from a healthy control slice at baseline (no pharmacological stimulation) is shown in <strong>Fig2e</strong>.

                    Of the 4 cryopreserved slices with maintained electrical activity, the slice depicted in <strong>Fig2</strong> showed no signs of macro cracking. Large thermal gradients applied across a volume of tissue after a phase change are likely to cause cracking. Future experiments will involve tuning the vitrification and rewarming profile aiming to completely avoid cracking while also cooling and warming fast enough to avoid damaging ice formation.

                    Here, we demonstrate recovery of electrical activity in previously cryopreserved acute rodent neural tissue. Due to the high viscosity of vitrified water, bringing a sample to LN2 temperature (-196ºC) allows for virtually indefinite storage due to the extreme slowing of molecular motion, stopping metabolism and preventing ice formation.

                    The finding that neural tissue can reach LN2 temperature and be rewarmed to recover electrical activity marks an important milestone on the trajectory to an acute slice preservation protocol appropriate for the storage of acutely resected human tissue for research applications.

                    Iterations and improvements to this protocol will be necessary to achieve a level of preservation and functional viability required for translatable research using this method. Continued screening of highly effective and minimally toxic CPA formulations specifically targeted for neural tissue will enable improved viability.

                    Additionally, this work sheds light on the possibility of whole body reversible cryopreservation, which would enable medical hibernation to halt the progression of terminal diseases showing promise of a cure in the foreseeable future. We predict that neural tissue will pose a particular challenge compared to other organs due to limited capacity for regeneration, low redundancy, high osmotic sensitivity, and the presence of the blood brain barrier which may limit uptake of cryoprotective agents.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Cryoprotectant Loading</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Acute cerebellar slices were loaded with VMPnoX cryoprotectant solution (53% w/v cryoprotectants) through a controlled diffusion process. The tissue was placed in a multifunctional sample holder with a custom well for diffusive loading of cryoprotectant.

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">Vitrification Protocol</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Tissue samples were rapidly cooled from 4ºC to -196ºC using a jet of liquid nitrogen (LN2). Cooling rates of 1140 ºC/min were achieved for the slices reported in the study. A thermocouple placed next to the slice was monitored, and LN2 flow was maintained for 30 seconds after minimum temperature had been reached.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">AMF Rewarming</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    After holding at -196ºC for 1 minute, flow of LN2 was halted and the sample was quickly rewarmed using an AMF electromagnet operating at 15W field strength and ~70kHz frequency. A rate of 1280 ºC/min was reached for the slice reported in the study.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">CPA Unloading</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    After rewarming, the vitrification hat was removed and the perfusion hat was re-installed. The CPA unloading protocol included a 500 second linear ramp from 53% to 0% w/v CPA, followed by 10 minutes of 0% w/v CPA.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">MEA Slice Electrophysiology</h3>
                  <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                    Viability in tissue slices was evaluated by multi-electrode array electrophysiology using the 3Brain BioCAM DupleX system. The 3Brain HD-MEA Acura 2D chip model was used, with 4,096 electrodes in a working area of 3.84mm x 3.84mm. Recordings were acquired with 20kHz sampling frequency.
